# Python_Projects
Python Exercises from the Python Crash Course book.

# What I learned

I learned the basics of python development and even modified a few of the exercises to do different things. Topics learned were the basics such as loops, conditionals, tuples, variables, etc. I also learned how to create classes, how to import different classes and specific functions, create functions, and develop some unit tests. I also learned that python is an interpreted language and hence runs and compiles differently from a static language such as java or c. 

# Challenges

I am coming from a Java background so learning different syntax patterns such as required identations and no semicolons were a small daily challenge. I also found it challenging yet amusing on the way python makes you create objects (such as importing the acutal 'constructor' from its own class eg. from car import car). Other than that it was just a matter of understanding the syntax of the python language and create small simple programs from it.
