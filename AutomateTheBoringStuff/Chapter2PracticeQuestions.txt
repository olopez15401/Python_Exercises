1) What are the two values of the Booleam data type? How do you write them?

    Boolean values are either True or False. 

     a_variable = False

    a boolean must be True or False and must be capitalized.

2) What are the three boolean operators?

    and
    or 
    not

3) Write out the truth tables of each boolean operator.

            False   True
    True    False   True
    False   True    False

4) What do the following expressions evaluate to?

    (5 < 4) and ( 3 == 5) --> False
    not (5 < 4)           --> True
    (5 < 4) or ( 3 == 5)  --> False
    (True and True) and (True == False) --> False
    (not False) or (not True) --> True

5) What are the six comparison operators?

    >
    <
    ==
    >=
    <=
    !=

6) What is the difference between the equal operator and the assignment operator?

        = <-- assignment operator. Assigns a value to a variable.
        == <-- equal operator. Evaluates two expressions or values / variables / function calls as True or False.

7) Explain what a condition is and where would you use one.
    A condition is an expression that evaluates to some boolean condition and is used to control the flow of the program
    such as using if else loops or while loops.

8) Identify the three blocks in this code:

    spam = 0
    if spam == 10:
        print('eggs')
        if spam > 5:
            print('bacon')
        else:
            print('ham')
        print('spam')
    print('spam')

9) Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is
   stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

    class Spam():

        def spam_it():
            spam = Input()

            if(spam == 1):
                print('Hello')
            elif(spam == 2):
                print('Howdy')
            else:
                print('Greetings')

10) What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
    Ctrl + C

11) What is the difference between break and continue?
    break initiates the flow out of the loop and continue keeps the flow of the program 
    in the enclosed block.

12) What is the difference between range(10), range(0,10), and range(0,10,1)?
    
    No difference.

13) Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then 
    write an equivalent program that uses a while loop.

14) If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how 
    would you call it after importing spam?

    spam.bacon()
