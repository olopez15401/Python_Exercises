1) Which of the following are operators and which are values?

*           <-- operator
'hello'     <-- values
-88.8       <-- values
-           <-- operator
/           <-- operator
+           <-- operator
5           <-- values

4) What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
    An expression is a combination of values and variables or function calls that evaluate to a single value.

5) What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
    An expression evaluates to a single value whereas a statement assigns a value to some variable.

6) What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?
    
    bacon = 20
    bacon + 1

    bacon would contain the int 21.

7) What should the following two expressions evaluate to?

8) Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
    eggs is lowercase, is not a keyword, and does not start with a number.
    100 is an integer value and hence is not translated as a variable.

9) What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating point number, or string version of a value?

    int()
    float()
    str()

    These are casting functions.

10) Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?

    'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

    Python cannot convert an int object to a str implicitly/

    corrected:

        'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'

    int objects must be casted as a string object explicitly.
